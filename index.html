        <p>She is half dalmation/ half dachshund. Her father.. he was the dachshund. We are not exactly sure how that worked out. I am sure there was a ladder or a step stool involved.</p>

        Meet Tasha</h2>

        <img src="images/tasha.jpg">
        <p>Tasha was my puppy. She was also a pit/shepard mix. She was the best dog I have ever owned.</p>
        <p>She was a rescue puppy from Texas. The people who owned her left her in the hot Texas sun without food and water. They also use to beat her.</p>
        <p>I had Tasha for 8 years. We had to put her to sleep on 1/1/2015 due to a rapidly growing spinal tumor. I miss my baby.</p>
